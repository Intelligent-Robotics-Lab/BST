# BST Program

This Behavior Skills Training (BST) program uses the Furhat and NAO social robots to simulate and assess Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Discrete Trial Training (DTT) sessions for children with ASD. It recognizes verbal and non-verbal inputs from an interventionist, tracking their state in the training and giving feedback on protocol adherence.


## Phases of BST

- **Introduction**: Furhat briefly explains the ABA DTT protocol to the interventionist.
- **Demonstration**: Furhat demonstrates ideal usage with NAO.
- **Rehearsal**: The interventionist performs ABA DTT on NAO while Furhat evaluates.
- **Feedback**: Furhat relays personalized feedback to the interventionist and generates a viewable PDF of the interventionist's performance.

## Files

- **Main.py**: Core program logic.
- **Verbals.py**: Dictionaries that store ideal phrasings of instructions, reinforcements, prompts, and error corrections. The LLM compares the interventionists' semantics to the ideal phrasings in this file to determine if they match or are synonymous.
- **NonVerbals.py**: Algorithms that check for limb locations and facial expressions, as needed in certain trials.
